# spotify
Uses spotify api to generate wordclouds and posters from spotify playlist links

Wordclouds are generated by scraping lyrics from genius.com for each lyric, then removes common words like "and", "the", "I", etc.

For the mosaic images, I downloaded all the album covers from a playlist and then using KMeans Clustering, I got the dominant HSV of each image then sorted the images based off of those values to create a rainbow effect.
